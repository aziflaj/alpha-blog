This is a Rails Blog application developed while following a Udemy course on Ruby on Rails development.

The whole application is developed from scratch, with minimal gem and generators usage, in order to let the student learn more about how Rails works behind the scenes.

The application contains automated testing code for unit, functional and integration testing for avoiding bugs as much as possible.
